        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said, <q>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.”</q> The
            farmer said, <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
            with it,
            and in the
            evening
            everybody came back and said, <q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                horses!”</q>
            The farmer again said, <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q>“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,"</q> and the farmer
            responded,
            <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q> The
            next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
            had a
            broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said,
            <q><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></q>
        </p>
        <figure>
            <blockquote>whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                impossible
                to
                tell
                whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
                because you never know what will be the consequence of
                the
                misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
                class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for
            bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
