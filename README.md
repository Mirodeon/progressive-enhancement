## Challenge learning about HTML and CSS especially semantics and layouts 

I have to convert this [text](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Jepsen-6/blob/master/01-the-field/04-html-css/01-fundamentals/resources/doc-the-chinese-farmer.txt) into HTML and put some pretty good semantics in then play with css and some exercises.
